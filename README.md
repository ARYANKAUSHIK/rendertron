# bot-render [![Build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/samuelli/bot-render.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/samuelli/bot-render)

A Docker container which runs headless Chrome and renders web pages on the fly, which
can be set up to serve pages to search engines, social networks and link rendering
bots.

## Installing & deploying

### Dependencies
This project requires Node 7+ and Docker ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)). For deployment this
project uses the [Google Cloud Platform SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

### Installing
Install node dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
```

Install Chrome:
```bash
apt-get install google-chrome
```

### Running locally
With a local instance of Chrome installed, you can start the server locally:
```bash
npm start
```

To test a rendering, send a request:
```
http://localhost:3000/?url=https://dynamic-meta.appspot.com
```

### Docker
After installing docker, build the docker image:
```bash
docker build -t bot-render . --no-cache=true
```

### Running the container

There are two ways to run the container locally:
1. [Recommended] - Use [Jessie Frazelle' seccomp profile](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles/blob/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json) and `-security-opt` flag
2. Utilize the `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` flag

In the case where your kernel lacks user namespace support or are receiving a `ECONNREFUSED` error when trying to access the service in the container (as noted in issues [2](https://github.com/samuelli/bot-render/issues/2) and [3](https://github.com/samuelli/bot-render/issues/3)), both methods above should resolve the problem.

[Recommended] Start a container with the built image using Jessie Frazelle' seccomp profile for Chrome:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json -O ~/chrome.json
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --security-opt seccomp=$HOME/chrome.json --name bot-render-container bot-render
```

Start a container with the built image using SYS_ADMIN:
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --name bot-render-container bot-render
```

Send a request to the server running inside the container:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/?url=https://dynamic-meta.appspot.com
```

Stop the container:
```bash
docker kill bot-render-container
```

Clear containers:
```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Deploying to Google Cloud Platform
```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project <your-project-id>
```

## Rendering
Once you have the service up and running, you'll need to implement the differential serving
layer. This checks the user agent to determine whether prerendering is required.

### Query parameters
When setting query parameters as part of your URL, ensure they are encoded correctly. In JS,
this would be `encodeURIComponent(myURLWithParams)`.

### Web components
Headless Chrome supports web components but shadow DOM is difficult to serialize effectively.
As such, shady DOM is required for web components.

If you are using web components v0 (deprecated), you will need to enable Shady DOM to
render correctly. In Polymer 1.x, which uses web components v0, Shady DOM is enabled by default.
If you are using Shadow DOM, override this by setting the query parameter `dom=shady` when
directing requests to the bot-render service.

If you are using web components v1 and either `webcomponents-lite.js` or `webcomponents-loader.js`,
set the query parameter `wc-inject-shadydom=true` when directing requests to the bot-render
service. This renderer service will force the necessary polyfills to be loaded and enabled.

## Middleware
